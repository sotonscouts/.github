## We're Southampton City Scouts ðŸ‘‹

We oversee the delivery of Scouting across 11 locations in Southampton with over 900 youth members aged 4 - 18 and over 450 adult volunteers from a diverse range of backgrounds.
With opportunities for adventurous activities, development of leadership skills and learning skills for life, we welcome people from all ages and backgrounds to get involved in Scouting.
We also operate a [youth activity centre](https://wilverley.southamptoncityscouts.org.uk) in the New Forest that benefits a range of youth groups including DofE, Guiding, and schools.

### Scouts, on GitHub?

Yes! Whilst we love the great outdoors, camping, hiking and exploring our world, we're also keen to build new digital tools and games to make the delivery of Scouting easier and more fun!

Keep an eye on this space, we have some very exciting open source projects in the pipeline and cannot wait to share them with other Scouts, Guides and beyond!

### Can I get involved?

Definitely! You **donâ€™t need experience in Scouting or coding** â€” everyone is welcome.
